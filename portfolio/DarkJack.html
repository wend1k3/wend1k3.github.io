        <p>DarkJack is a 2D single-player card game in which the player plays Blackjack against a devil. Being perceptive when facing the devil is the only way for the player to win.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I personally:</p>
        <p class="tab-text">路 Implemented core Blackjack mechanism and cheating mechanism for our game purpose</p>
        <p class="tab-text">路 Implemented on-click interactions with game objects for puzzle-solving purpose</p>
        <p class="tab-text">路 Integrated sound effects and background music</p>
        <p class="tab-text">路 Implemented UI panels for player interactions and status display</p>
        <br>
        <p>The theme we selected is "No chance of winning!!?". We came up with an idea of a gambit game in which a player can't win until the realization of opponent's cheating. Later, we enriched the story by giving background and different endings based on player's choice near the deadline</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is my second time for game jam. I'm glad that I'm able to use data structures (array and list) knowledge from course and apply in the implementation of the game mechanism. Due to the time limit, we weren't able to finish all we want to present, so we decided to continue working on this project.</p>
