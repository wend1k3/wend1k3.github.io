        <p>EquiLearn Adventure is a two-player, split screen maze game in which there are random-scattered objects (box and books) in the map.
           The box have two types, either a timer object that can increase/decrease the player time, or a exam object that would decrease the player's knowledge.
            The book object would increase the player's knowledge. All these values are randomly assigned.
            If the player's knowledge exceed the maximum capacity or becomes a negative value, then the player would overload, which would reflect on the player's walking speed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I personally:</p>
        <p class="tab-text">路 Designed and implemented the game mechanism and the split screen feature</p>
        <p class="tab-text">路 Designed and constructed the level (maze) of the game using pixel image and then stored the values by utilizing arrays</p>
        <p class="tab-text">路 Implemented interactions between game objects</p>
        <p class="tab-text">路 Implemented UI panels for character selection and main game with status display</p>
        <br>
        <p>The track we selected is "Education Equity".
            We hope that using different walk speeds for characters, players would understand that in reality the access to education is in inequity</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is my first time participating in a hackathon.
            Although I have some years of experience in Python, this is my first time using Pygame
            and I'm glad that I managed to present a playable game under 24 hours. (And I realized 24 hours is too short for developing a game ;p)</p>
