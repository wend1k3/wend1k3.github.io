    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>My interest in Computer Science can be traced back to 2014 when <em>The Imitation Game</em> was released. I was amazed by the story, and from there, I got obsessed with the idea that one could model complex questions under mathematical frameworks so neatly and logically.
    Not until high school did I first got in touch with real programming. My first hand-on project is writing a web-scrapping script for past-paper downloading in Python due to the need for massive practice preparing for the IGCSE exams.
        I could still remember the excitement in realizing that I could solve real-world problem through coding, which prompts me to learn more about Computer Science.

    In my spare time, I like to play video games and am currently playing <em><a href="https://games.sega.com/lostjudgment/">Lost Judgement</a></em>. My interest in games leads me to self-study Unity at the start of 2024.
        Aside from games, I love playing badminton, a sport I started playing since primary school.
